Homebrew puzzle game for 3DO, inspired by an early 90s Microsoft game (Rodents Revenge).

The objective of this game is to trap cats by moving blocks. A cat is trapped if it cannot move in any direction. Once all on-screen cats are trapped they will turn into cheese which the player can eat for points. Cats will get faster and their counts will increase as the game progresses. Cats are able to move diagonally, so watch those corners!

NTSC and PAL are supported.
