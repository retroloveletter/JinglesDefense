Homebrew puzzle game for 3DO.

The objective of this game is to trap all the cats by moving blocks. A cat is trapped if it cannot move whatsoever in any direction (motionless). Once all cats on-screen are trapped they will turn into cheese, which the player can eat for points. As the game progresses, the cats will get faster and their counts will increase.
